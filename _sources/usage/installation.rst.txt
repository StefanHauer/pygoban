Installation
============

Download `this repository <https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/>`_, change the directory to that folder and install via pip:

.. code-block:: bash

   cd C:\downloaded\folder
   pip install .

Alternatively, if you download the repository directly your site-packages folder or anywhere else on your Python path, you should be able to use this library right away. Just make sure that you have all the dependencies installed, which you can check out `here <https://github.com/StefanHauer/pygoban/blob/develop/pyproject.toml>`_.
